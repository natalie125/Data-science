This group project is aimed to understanding The Impact of Social Isolation and Loneliness in a Game Environment. It was done by the owner of the repository, Sandra Guran and Ayesha Rahman. This project investigates the impact of self-isolation and social distancing on playersâ€™ gaming behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a dataset containing players' self-reported isolation duration, emotional responses, regional data, and in-game activity logs, the project aims to:

1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and behavioural patterns across different regions and isolation durations.

2. Identify which in-game behaviours are most strongly associated with the length of time a player has been self-isolating.

3. Develop a machine learning model that predicts a player's self-isolation duration based solely on behavioural features such as session frequency, playtime, interaction levels, and time-of-day activity.

The findings contribute to understanding how prolonged isolation influences digital behaviour and may support future research on psychological well-being in gaming environments. The model can also serve as a foundation for designing adaptive game experiences that respond to player states in real-time.
